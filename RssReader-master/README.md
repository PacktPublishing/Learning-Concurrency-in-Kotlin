## Learning Concurrency in Kotlin - RSS Reader
Throughout the book Learning Concurrency in Kotlin we put in practice most of the topics by writing an iterating over an RSS Reader for Android. This repository contains the final code for each chapter.

You can find more information about the book [here](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-concurrency-kotlin).
